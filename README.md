# DriverGame

In this PhoneGap web application, the user has to avoid appearing barriers to the left or right with his car to improve his score.

__Disclaimer:__ This project was developed within the context of a university lecture.

## Project description

The game is drawn in a HTML5 canvas. Buttons to drive left and right are available. The barriers are generated randomly and the speed of the car will increase little by little.
